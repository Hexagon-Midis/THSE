# THSE (The Helper Setup Extension)
The-Helper-Setup-Extension Use this if you want to install the required files for The Helper, this is for if you dont want to use the .VBS Files... (Windows also says they are viruses, in which they are not, Windows will delete it if no action is taken, and then The Helper cant download the required files with those .VBS Files...)
